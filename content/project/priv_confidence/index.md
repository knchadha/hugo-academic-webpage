title: Private confidence sets using aggregation of subsampled bootstraps
summary: We give differentially private algorithms for estimating coverage probabilities and computing valid confidence sets, and prove upper bounds on the error of our estimates and the length of our confidence sets. Our methods outperform normal approximation based confidence sets whenever bootstrapping outperforms normal approximation in the non-private case.
